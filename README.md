# Python Charts Gallery
This Jupyter notebook is a collection of visualizations with python. I often find it time-consuming to make charts since I need to search for multiple sites to be able to make good charts with legends, data labels, and customized axis. Hence I built this notebook to help myself and save time when making data visualizations.
