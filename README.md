# Python Charts Gallery
This Jupyter notebook is a collection of visualizations with python. I often find it time-consuming to make charts since I usually need to search for multiple sites to be able to make good/complete charts with legends, data labels, and customized axis. Hence I built this notebook to help myself and save time when making data visualizations.

The inspiration & base code for the charts were taken from various references (as written in the notebook), but I added several things to ensure the viz looks clean and comply with best practice such as data labels, a clear & readable fonts, and better color with cmap rather than using the default matplotlib setting. So rather than googling for various references to make one complete chart (like I normally did) with all the attributes, this notebook will hopefully save time to make a nice-looking & easily understandable charts. The notebook will be continously updated as I add more charts.

## What's on the notebook
- Vertical & Horizontal Bar 
- Stacked Bar 
- 100% Stacked Bar 
- Doughnut (since I don't like pie chart)
- Lollipop chart to compare 2 values
- 2-sides bar chart

Next I'm planning to add Nested Pie Chart, Multiple Line Charts, Heatmap.
